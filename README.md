This is Gamesman5.

As of the writing of this document, this is the state of the project:

Framework
---------

This app is built on Sinatra, a lightweight web framework written in ruby, but
this shouldn't matter to the average gamescrafter writing games.

To run gamesman5 locally. Make sure you have ruby installed and then do the
following:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ rackup
```
